# eQuest Solutions - Fullstack Practical


I am using node  V18

Run both FrontEnd and BackEnd project using this cmd 
`npm start`


Your task is to develop a Product Inventory System, consisting of both frontend and backend components. The system should allow users to manage products and product categories. Follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for the backend and design a responsive frontend using ReactJS.

*Backend Requirements (Node.js with Express and MongoDB):*

* Authentication:
    * Implement authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
* Database Setup:
    * Set up a MongoDB database to store product and category data.
* Models:
    * Create Mongoose models for products and categories to interact with the MongoDB database.
* Controllers:
    * Implement controllers to handle CRUD operations for products and categories.
* Routes:
    * Define routes for various CRUD operations for products and categories.
* Default Value:
    * Update the status field in the products collection to have a default value of 0.

*Frontend Requirements (ReactJS):*
- User Interface:
    - Create a responsive user interface with ReactJS, consisting of the following views:
        - Login Page: Allow users to log in to the system.
        - Dashboard: Display a list of products and categories with options to add, edit, and delete.
        - Add/Edit Product Page: Allow users to add new products or edit existing ones.
        - Add/Edit Category Page: Allow users to add new categories or edit existing ones.
- Validation:
    - Implement client-side validation using ReactJS directives on add/edit product and category pages.
- API Integration:
   - Use ReactJS services to interact with backend APIs for CRUD operations on products and categories.

*Additional Instructions:*
- Ensure proper error handling and validation on both frontend and backend.
- Utilize Mongoose's validation features for server-side validation.
- Follow SOLID principles and write clean, maintainable code.
- Use GitHub for version control. Commit your code regularly with descriptive commit messages.
- Deploy the application on a local server or hosting platform for testing.

*Evaluation Criteria:*
- Functionality: Does the application meet the specified requirements, including CRUD operations and authentication?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, clean, and readable? Does it follow SOLID principles?
- Database Design: Is the database schema designed appropriately for products and categories?
- User Interface: Is the user interface intuitive and responsive across different devices?
- Error Handling: Does the application handle errors gracefully?
- API Integration: Are ReactJS services properly integrated with backend APIs for CRUD operations?

*Submission:*
- Provide a link to your GitHub repository containing the source code of your project.
- Provide instructions for setting up and running the application locally (if applicable).

*Additional Notes:*
- Be prepared to explain your code, design decisions, and any challenges faced during the implementation.
- Ensure your code is thoroughly tested before submission.

This practical task assesses your ability to develop a full-stack application using Node.js with Express for the backend, ReactJS for the frontend, and MongoDB for the database. It emphasises best practices in software development, including code quality, database design, and user interface design. 

Good luck!
